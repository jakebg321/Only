## ⚠️ SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

The system CAN'T detect:
- Actual age (only behavior patterns)
- Real marital status (only guilt/avoidance)
- Income level (only spending willingness)
- True identity (only psychological patterns)

The system assumes:
- Avoidance = Guilt = Likely married
- Oversharing = Loneliness
- Instant responses = Impulsivity/Arousal
- Price questions = Low commitment
