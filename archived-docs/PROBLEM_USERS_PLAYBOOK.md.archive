- "how much is this?" [late night, hesitation]
- "what are your rates?" [after guilt questions]

---

## üí∞ PSYCHOLOGICAL DETECTION & RESPONSE SYSTEM

### **Context-Aware Detection Framework:**

**BEFORE responding to "problem" behavior, ALWAYS check:**
1. **Time of message** (late night = possible guilt)
2. **Response timing** (instant = possible addict, delayed = possible guilt)
3. **Previous conversation context** (what triggered this behavior?)
4. **Language patterns** (avoidance vs directness vs oversharing)
5. **Typing behavior** (stops, hesitation, editing)

### **Personality-Specific Auto-Response Templates:**

```
// MARRIED_GUILTY responses
DISCOUNT_REQUEST_GUILTY: "For someone like you, I keep things simple... quality and discretion come at a premium üòâ"
PRICE_QUESTION_GUILTY: "I only work with gentlemen who value privacy... that's worth paying for"
COMPARISON_GUILTY: "Cheaper girls don't know how to keep secrets like I do"

// LONELY_SINGLE responses  
CHATTY_LONELY: "I love talking with you... but deeper conversations are for my VIP members üíï"
PRICE_QUESTION_LONELY: "I don't just sell content, I sell experiences... let me show you what makes me special"

// HORNY_ADDICT responses
IMPATIENT_ADDICT: "So eager... I have something exclusive but it costs more üòà"
DEMANDING_ADDICT: "This price is for the next 10 minutes only... then it goes up"

// TOURIST responses
