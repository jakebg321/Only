## Conversation Intelligence

### Natural Preference Discovery
Through normal conversation, we learn about users to serve them better:

**Initial Conversations (Messages 1-10)**
- Learn communication style preferences
- Understand availability patterns

- Gauge engagement level

**Ongoing Learning (Continuous)**
- Track what content resonates
- Note conversation topics that engage
- Understand response patterns
- Identify preferred interaction times

### Behavioral Understanding
We pay attention to natural behavioral cues:
- **Response timing**: Helps understand availability and interest levels
- **Message length**: Indicates engagement and communication preference
- **Content interaction**: Shows what type of content provides value
- **Session patterns**: Helps creators know when to be available
